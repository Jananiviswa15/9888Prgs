Look into my eyes                       for a moment longer,

between deep sighs and petting my hair,

I can see reasons and I can see purpose.

Just hold your gaze for one more eternity:
<hr>
<span title = "hi">I may be able to make it out this time,</span>

again,

if you hold me,
<hr>
again. </pre>
