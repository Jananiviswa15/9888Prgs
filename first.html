<p> Hi, and welcome to this review 					of different types of triangles! Before we begin, here’s a review of the basics.









A triangle has three straight sides that connect. 						The length of the sides can vary but the length of the largest side can’t be equal or greater to the sum of the other two sides. In addition, a triangle has three interior angles, and the sum of those three angles is always 180 degrees. This is true for all triangles, including the six types we’re looking at today.</p>

<p>
We’re going to break our six types of triangles into two groups of three.</p>

<p>
Let’s start with the three types of triangles that are categorized by the measure of their largest angle. <span>These are the <strong>acute, right, </strong> and <b>obtuse </b>triangles<span> </p>  <div>
